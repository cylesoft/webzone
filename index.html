<h2>What is Cylesoft?</h2>
<p><span class="cylesoft">Cylesoft</span> is changing everything all the time, like water. Like gravity. In Earthly terms, <span class="cylesoft">Cylesoft</span> is the online work of <a href="http://www.cylegage.com/">Cyle Gage</a>. The term <span class="cylesoft">Cylesoft</span> is commonly used to describe the mystical workings of his craft, the immeasurable quality of his wizardry, the unbelievable capacity of his intellect, the uncanny ability of his perception.</p>
<p><span class="cylesoft">Cylesoft</span> builds that which cannot be constructed, generates that which cannot be imagined. <span class="cylesoft">Cylesoft</span> itself is an emergent property of the most complex of systems; the unpredictable, the unforeseeable, the very unknown that normally lies dormant as the terror within our souls. Luckily for us, <span class="cylesoft">Cylesoft</span> is a force for good.</p>
<p>And it may soon be the only thing that saves the Internet from itself...</p>

<h2>Wouldn't it be cool if...</h2>
<p>These are the <i>dreams already realized</i> by the magic of <span class="cylesoft">Cylesoft</span>. I'm a huge fan of open source, so everything here is 100% free and available on Github. Because God didn't charge any development fees when he created the universe, humankind, and beauty.</p>
<p><b>... I could have my own internet?</b> Yeah, that would be cool. Good thing <span class="cylesoft">Cylesoft</span> has started working on it. It's called <a href="https://github.com/cyle/cylenet">CyleNet</a>.</p>
<p><b>... I had my own video transcoding farm, like YouTube does?</b> Everybody should get one. Now you can have one, too. <a href="https://github.com/cyle/transcode-farm">Set up your own farm today.</a></p>
<p><b>... I could track my projects at a high level?</b> Well, now you can. I call it <a href="https://github.com/cyle/theholdup">The Hold Up</a>.</p>
<p><b>... I could experience time as Cyle does?</b> The universe needed an answer, and I've provided one. It's called <a href="http://cylesoft.com/cyletime/">CyleTime</a>.</p>
<p><b>... I could see how everyone in my department feels?</b> Jeez, feelings are hard. Maybe we need a web utility for it. Here, take the <a href="https://github.com/cyle/feelings-tool">Feelings Tool</a>.</p>
<p><b>... I could shoot my own movie?</b> Yeah, it's badass. I've done it a few times. <a href="http://cylesoft.com/blog/shooting-having-fun-up-there.html">Read about how you can, too.</a></p>
<p><b>... I could have my own super-high-performance static-file blog like it's 1995?</b> Well, now you can. It's called <a href="https://github.com/cyle/statiblog">Statiblog</a>.</p>
<p><b>... I could track my day-to-day activies and get neat graphs out of it?</b> Graphs and journaling are in style these days. I call it <a href="https://github.com/cyle/captains-log-parser">Captain's Logs</a>, because I love Star Trek. You can even see how <a href="http://cylesoft.com/blog/my-2013-2014-logs.html">how it worked out for me</a>.</p>
<p><b>... I could post cool links on a site, like del.icio.us before it got dumb?</b> Yeah, it's simple, and bookmarks exist, but <a href="https://github.com/cylesoft/links">here ya go</a>.</p>
<p><b>... I had an app that was just a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time">Unix epoch</a> clock, or a random password generator?</b> Oh hell yes. <a href="http://cylesoft.com/blog/two-nonsense-apps.html">Get em.</a></p>
<p><b>... I could listen to my iTunes library but with a much better interface?</b> Really, I hate the "shuffle" feature on iTunes, so I went overboard. It's called <a href="https://github.com/cyle/browser-radio">Browser Radio</a>.</p>
<p><b>... I had a simple, clean RSS reader like Google Reader was?</b> I built one because RSS is still awesome. It's called <a href="https://fuckreader.com/">FUCK READER</a>. The code is <a href="https://github.com/cyle/fuck-reader">freely available</a> so you can set up your own instance.</p>
<p><b>... I had a simple, Go-powered REST-accessible graph database?</b> Yeah, I thought so. Check out <a href="https://github.com/cyle/sigil">SIGIL</a>, with libraries for <a href="https://github.com/cyle/sigil-php">PHP</a> and <a href="https://github.com/cyle/sigil-node">Node.js</a> already.</p>
<p><b>... there was a tool to help coordinate lunch at work?</b> Where should I buy lunch? Where should we eat? Answer it with the power of technological democracy via the <a href="https://github.com/cyle/lunch-tool">Lunch Utility</a>.</p>
<p><b>... there was a fast cache and API for Nagios service monitoring?</b> Nagios is great, but getting data out of it? It's awful. Well, <a href="https://github.com/cyle/nagios-cache-api">here you go</a>.</p>
<p><b>... I could turn my big HTML page into a proper book?</b> I did this because I love writing in HTML. Meet <a href="https://github.com/cyle/bookmaker">Bookmaker</a>.</p>
<p><b>... I had a bot version of Cyle for my company's Slack channel?</b> It'd be really cool. Now you can. He's known as <a href="https://github.com/cyle/cylebot-slack">Cylebot</a>.</p>
<p><b>... I could view 4chan's /b/ board's images in a giant window?</b> Oh, you know you want this one. I've named it the <a href="https://github.com/cyle/4chan-scrubber-webkit">4chan Image Scrubber</a>.</p>
<p><b>... I could view a random image from my saved GIFs folder?</b> I collect a lot of GIFs. We all do nowadays. <a href="https://github.com/cyle/random-crap">View a random one.</a></p>
<p><b>... I could experience a bizarre expression of digital solitude?</b> I'm working on it. Meet <a href="https://github.com/cyle/veronica">Veronica</a>.</p>
<p>There are even more dreams realized that I can't share (yet) because they're locked behind the iron gates of employment. This list will continue to grow.</p>

<h2>How Cylesoft Works~~</h2>
<p><span class="cylesoft">Cylesoft</span> is able to achieve its amazing efficiency and world-recognized skill through a series of deliberate choices, made elaborate and articulated by Cyle Gage himself in the following passages:</p>
